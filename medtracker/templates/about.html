<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>To improve and safeguard the health of our entire Mount Sinai community, including our student researchers and clinicians, doctors, nurses, faculty, staff, and most importantly our patients.
</p>

<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>ISMMS Health Check is a new lightweight web app to simplify health workflows at ISMMS 
	through automated follow-up of medical protocols for critical health values. We have created if-this-then-that 
	style triggers for health data that takes the burden off health care providers to perform 
	follow-up while collecting data from patients and providers automatically.
